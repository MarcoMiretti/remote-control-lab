## Aeropendulum tools

The [aeropendulum-tools](https://github.com/MarcoMiretti/aeropendulum-tools), are a set of _octave_ and _python_ libraries that will help creating a control algorithm _without worrying about the embedded stuff!_

# Some oldies!

## The origins: aeropendulum

This was my control-systems final project at the university. [Aeropendulum](https://github.com/MarcoMiretti/aeropendulum) was a quite different approach to solve the same problem as one of the remote control-lab devices. The idea was the control the angle of a drone-helix-propelled pendulum.

The whole control system ran in a stm32f407 discovery board. While it was fun doing it almost from scratch (without external HALs), the idea was planted then and there... How can someone do this without having to worry about the non control-related knowledge?
